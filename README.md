## Quickstart

To get started, run the following commands in your console:

```sh
# Initializes template in your workspace:
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-stacks/playwright

# Starts dev server:
npm run dev
```

> Notes: Cloning the repository instead of initializing it with the above commands, will result in a inappropriate experience. This template uses `remix.init` to configure itself and prepare your environment.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.<br/><br/>
Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests, build, etc.<br/>
Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Playwright

We use Playwright for End-to-End tests. You'll find those in the `tests/e2e` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `tests/e2e` directory to test your changes.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev`.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.

This template has pre-configured prettier settings on `.package-json`. Feel free to update each value with your preferred work style.

## Support

If you found the template useful, support it with a [Star ‚≠ê](https://github.com/dev-xo/stripe-stack)<br />
It helps the repository grow and gives me motivation to keep working on it. Thanks you!
